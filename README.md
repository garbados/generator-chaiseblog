# Generator-chaiseblog
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/garbados/generator-chaiseblog.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/garbados/generator-chaiseblog)

A generator for Yeoman; builds [chaise blog](https://github.com/garbados/chaiseblog), a private blog for those thoughts you want to reflect on alone. Check out the [demo](http://chaisedemo.maxthayer.org/#/) :D

## Getting started

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-chaiseblog`
- Run: `yo chaiseblog`
- Answer the prompted questions; this will inform the generator how and where to install your Chaise Blog.
- If the database where you want your blog to live doesn't exist yet, go make it. I'll just put on some tea while you do.
- Welcome back! The tea's ready. Now, run: `grunt`

Your blog should now be live on the world wide interwebs!
